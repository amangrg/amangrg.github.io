When I saw this film, I was expecting many things: a beautifully animated film, a twist on the Pinnocchio formula, redemption at the end - all this was delivered, and yet I was unprepared for the sentimentality with which this film is woven and the Christian themes in it.

There's a scene where pointing at Jesus's statue which Gepetto is slowly building, Pinocchio asks, "Why do they love him and not me, Papa? I am made of wood too." Instead of answering this question directly, Del Toro chooses to craft a gut-wrenching film that has this question at its heart.

It was no coincidence that the bomb that kills Gepetto's son Carlos also destroys the statue of Jesus he was helping build. Central to this film is Gepetto's loss of faith. (Not surprising given that Del Toro describes himself as a lapsed Catholic.) After this, Gepetto takes matters into his own hands and attempts to do what God isn't: give life to his dead son.

Carlos never comes to life, but Pinocchio does. Pinnocchio is a reflection of Carlos in some ways and an entirely new person in others. He is rambunctious, defiant, and, most importantly, highly impressionable. He is a blank slate upon which everyone will write their stories.

Throughout the film, everyone uses Pinnocchio for their selfish ends, and Pinnochio, a Christ-like figure, has to carry the burden of their sins.

Pinnochio eventually makes the ultimate sacrifice and gives up his life for that of his father. What follows is a gut-wrenching scene where Gepetto holds Pinnocchio's lifeless body and weeps (along with the viewer). By making this sacrifice, Pinnochio has risen to divinity in the narrative. In the end, "they" from the question (now meaning the viewers) grow to love Pinnocchio unconditionally due to his Christ-like sacrifice. This parallelism is only strengthened when he ressurects and reunites with Gepetto.
